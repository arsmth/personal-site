      <AboutSection>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m a games student at the University of Salford in MediaCityUK with a focus on gameplay programming in C# working with the Unity game engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my own time I have a passion for front-end web development and graphic design, especially producing brand identities and distinctive online presences for local businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to create unique, enjoyable experiences and I believe that good design can elevate a small business and provide them with the means to compete with the bigger players in their field from the get-go.
