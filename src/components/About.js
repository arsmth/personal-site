      <AboutSection>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m a games student at the University of Salford in MediaCityUK with a focus in gameplay programming using C# and the Unity game engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my own time I have a passion for front-end web development, especially creating unique experiences for local businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that good design can elevate a small or emerging company and level the playing field by providing them with the means to compete with the bigger players in their field from the get-go.
